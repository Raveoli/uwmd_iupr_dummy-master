# The Institute for Urban Policy Research - The Dallas Indicators Project
I am building a website as my role as a Research Assistant at The Institute for Urban Policy Research. The website displays income, health and education statistics of people in different demographics in Dallas.

The website is built using Material Design Lite, AngularJS, NodeJS, LeafletJS and CartoDB API.

The website is a work in progress: https://iupr.herokuapp.com/#
