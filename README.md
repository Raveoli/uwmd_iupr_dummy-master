# The Institute for Urban Policy Research - The Dallas Indicators Project
I built a web application as my role as a Research Assistant at The Institute for Urban Policy Research for a client called United Way. 

The website displays income, health and education statistics of people in different demographics, particularly in Dallas, using a map interface. This helps users understand which areas are under poverty(for example) based on the heatmap generated and whether the areas are getting the funding they need from non-profit organizations.

Technologies used:
1. Angularjs
2. Nodejs
3. Javascript
4. JQuery
5. Bootstrap
6. Leafletjs for building and manipulating the map.
7. CartoDB API to access data

This is a dummy website which hides private information (not the actual application): https://iuprdummy.herokuapp.com/#
